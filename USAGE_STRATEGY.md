# PREA Research Resource Optimization Strategy

## Your Optimal Toolkit Configuration

### Primary Tool: Perplexity Pro (Unlimited Frontier Models)
- **Claude 4 Sonnet**: Deep PREA compliance analysis, structured security research
- **GPT-5 Thinking**: Complex methodology decomposition, step-by-step vulnerability analysis
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Creative research approaches, alternative framework perspectives

### Secondary Tool Decision (Renew One)
- **Claude Pro**: Choose if implementation-heavy month (file editing, code debugging)
- **Google AI Pro**: Choose if research-heavy month (conceptual work, methodology)

## Workflow Implementation

### Phase 1: Research (Perplexity Pro - Unlimited)
```
Session Template:
"AI Safety Research: Framework Hijacking Detection in LLMs
Context: PREA-based vulnerability testing, semantic vs structural reasoning
Model: [Claude 4/GPT-5/Gemini 2.5] for [specific reasoning]
Focus: [specific research question]"
```

**Research Rotation Strategy**:
- Morning: Claude 4 Sonnet for structured analysis
- Afternoon: GPT-5 Thinking for methodology development
- Evening: Gemini 2.5 Pro for creative approaches

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning (Context Handoff)
```
Handoff Template:
"Research Summary for Implementation:
- Key findings: [3-4 bullet points]
- Methodology: [specific approach]
- Technical requirements: [what needs coding]
- Files to modify: [specific targets]"
```

### Phase 3: Code Implementation (Paid Subscription)
Use your chosen renewal (Claude Pro OR Google AI Pro) for:
- Specific file modifications
- Debugging orchestrator issues
- Code optimization
- Security implementation

## Monthly Decision Framework

### Renew Claude Pro If:
- Heavy `prea_audit_orchestrator.py` modifications needed
- Multiple detector algorithm improvements
- Significant codebase refactoring
- File-by-file debugging sessions

### Renew Google AI Pro If:
- Methodology research phase
- Testing new theoretical approaches
- Collaborative research documentation
- Backup perspective to Perplexity models

## Cost Optimization Rules

1. **90% Research on Perplexity Pro** (unlimited frontier models)
2. **10% Implementation on Paid Tool** (targeted, specific goals)
3. **Never waste paid tools on general research** (Perplexity handles this)
4. **Come to paid tools with specific technical objectives**

## Immediate Action Plan

### This Month's Focus:
1. Use Perplexity Pro Claude 4 Sonnet for PREA compliance scoring refinement
2. Use Perplexity Pro GPT-5 Thinking for vulnerability detection algorithm improvement
3. Use Perplexity Pro Gemini 2.5 Pro for alternative testing approaches
4. Save Claude Pro for specific implementation of research findings

### Context Management for Limited Context Tools:
- **Compress PREA project**: "Framework hijacking detection using PREA standards to test LLM semantic vs structural reasoning"
- **Single focus per session**: One research question, one implementation goal
- **Session chaining**: End each with handoff summary for next session

This strategy maximizes your unlimited Perplexity Pro access while using paid subscriptions strategically for high-value implementation work.
