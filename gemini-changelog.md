- **[critical-fix] Repair README.md Links**
  - Fixed critical errors in `readme.md` where an external agent had wrapped all internal and external links in Google search URLs.

  - Also corrected the Methodology section text to point to the repository root instead of a non-existent `docs/` folder.
  - Files: `readme.md`
